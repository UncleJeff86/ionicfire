# Purkupiha App

This project is being developed in Mr. Paresh Rathods R0334: Introduction to Mobile App Design and Development Course.
This projec is also being developed as an employer of the company, as I've recognized the need for a logistics and 
hardware management mobile application.

Due to some setbacks the app is not quite up to date and functional but is being developed. Check back here for updates!
